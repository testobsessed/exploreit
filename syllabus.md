# Abstract

Software is full of surprises. 
No matter how careful or skilled you are, when you create software it 
can behave differently than you intended. 
Exploratory testing mitigates those risks by uncovering surprises, risks, and potentially serious bugs. 
Rather than designing all tests in advance, explorers design and 
execute small, rapid experiments, using what they learned from the 
last little experiment to inform the next.

This highly interactive course teaches you the essential skills of a master explorer. 
You'll learn how to analyze software to discover key points of vulnerability, 
how to design experiments on the fly, 
how to hone your observation skills, 
and how to frame charters to focus your efforts.

You can apply the techniques in this course to any kind of software. 
Whether you work on embedded systems, Web applications, desktop applications, 
APIs, or something else, you'll find this course contains a wealth of 
concrete and practical techniques for exploring your software to 
discover its capabilities, limitations, and risks.

# Course Outline

1. On Testing and Exploration
  * Two sides of testing
  * Defining exploratory testing
  * Practice session: taking a tour of your target

1. Observing
  * Observing carefully
  * Making the invisible visible
  * Practice session: exploring to discover surprises
  
1. Finding Interesting Variations
  * What's a variable?
  * Recognizing subtle variables
  * Practice session: exploring to discover variables

1. Charters
  * Using charters to focus exploratory sessions
  * Identifying sources of charters
  * Good and bad charters
  * Practice session: the Nightmare Headline game

1. Evaluating Results
  * Defining expected behavior
  * Sources of expectations
  * Practice session: defining always and nevers
