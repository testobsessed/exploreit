Explore It!
===========

A classroom training course based on my book published by Pragmatic Bookshelf, Explore It!

Obviously there is not much here yet. You're probably better off checking back sometime later.

But if you really want to know what's going on, here's my intention:

* These will be course notes for an open source class based on my book, Explore It!
* I have not yet chosen a license for these notes. Until I do, this repository is copyrighted by me, Elisabeth Hendrickson, with all rights reserved.
* Once I do choose a license, the terms of use for my class will be that in lieu of a licensing fee to use this class, you must provide each of your students with a copy of Explore It! that you purchase direct from the Pragmatic Bookshelf website (so, that is, direct from the publisher, not from a distributor).


## Anticipated Frequenty Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Why do you require purchasing Explore It! direct from the publisher instead of through some other channel?

I'm not asking for a licensing fee for this courseware, so the way I get paid for my effort is by selling more books. If you buy direct from my publisher, I get a higher percentage of the sale.

For what it's worth, the publisher is probably the best source for bulk orders anyway. If you will be running this class for a large number of participants, contact them to ask about a bulk discount.
