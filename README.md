Explore It!
===========

This is a classroom training course based on my book published by Pragmatic Bookshelf, [Explore It!](http://pragprog.com/book/ehxta/explore-it)

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

In order to display the slides for the class, you need the following software installed:

* [git](http://git-scm.com/) (the instructions assume you are using a command line git client.)
* [NPM](https://npmjs.org/)
* [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome)

## Display the Slides

1. Clone this repository:

  `git clone --recursive https://github.com/testobsessed/exploreit`

1. Install the dependencies:

  `npm install`

1. Start the server to display the slides:

  `grunt serve`

1. Browse to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

1. Select Enter Presentation Mode from the View menu in Chrome to display the presentation.

## What to Expect

Obviously there is not much here yet. You're probably better off checking back sometime later.

But if you really want to know what's going on, here's my intention:

* These will be course notes for an open source class based on my book, Explore It!
* I have not yet chosen a license for these notes. Until I do, the contents of this repository (not including the reveal.js submodule) is copyrighted by me, Elisabeth Hendrickson, with all rights reserved.
* Once I do choose a license, the terms of use for my class will be that in lieu of a licensing fee to use this class, you must provide each of your students with a copy of Explore It! that you purchase direct from the Pragmatic Bookshelf website (so, that is, direct from the publisher, not from a distributor).


## Anticipated Frequenty Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Why do you require purchasing Explore It! direct from the publisher instead of through some other channel?

I'm not asking for a licensing fee for this courseware, so the way I get paid for my effort is by selling more books. If you buy direct from my publisher, I get a higher percentage of the sale.

For what it's worth, the publisher is probably the best source for bulk orders anyway. If you will be running this class for a large number of participants, contact them to ask about a bulk discount.

# About Reveal JS

This course uses Hakim El Hattab's marvelous presentation framework, [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/), for which I am extremely grateful. The framework is included as a submodule to make it easy to get started while still making it easy for me to keep the framework up to date.

Reveal.js is copyrighted by
Hakim El Hattab and redistributed here in accordance with [the licensing terms for reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/LICENSE).
