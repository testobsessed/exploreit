# Dual License

This license file sets forth terms for both non-commercial and commercial use.

## Non-Commercial Use

In this context, examples of non-commercial uses include (but are not limited to):

* Your own personal use
* Peer-based study groups where no money changes hands
* A class that is open to the public and offered free-of-charge

For such uses, these course materials are released under the [BY-NC-SA (Attribution, Non-Commercial, Share Alike) Creative Commons 4.0 License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.en_US). 

That means you may use, modify, and re-distribute these materials as long as you provide attribution and, if you choose to share your modified version, release that under the same BY-NC-SA license.

## Commercial Use

In this context, examples of a commercial offering include (but are not limited to):

* Private classes or study groups for a specific company or other commercial entity (even if the instructor is not being paid to run the class)
* For-pay public classes
* Workshops at for-pay conferences
* Study as part of a coaching engagement

You are welcome to use these materials, or a modified version of these materials, as the basis for a commercial offering (class, workshop, study group, etc.) as long as you purchase copies of [_Explore It!_ by Elisabeth Hendrickson](http://pragprog.com/book/ehxta/explore-it) (either the ebook or the paper version) from [Pragmatic Bookshelf](http://pragprog.com) for the students, one copy per student.

## FAQs

### The student already has a copy of the book. Do I really need to buy another copy?

Yup. 

Look at this from my perspective: I put years of work into creating this class and you get to use it -- without all the hassle of developing your own curriculum -- for the paltry sum of purchasing a book per student. It's like a licensing fee, but it's one that's super easy for both of us to deal with.

If it bothers you to buy an unneeded book, here are some options:

* You could consider buying the student a format they don't already have (e.g. a paper copy if they have the eBook). 
* You could offer the additional copy to the student and allow them to decide what to do with it. 
* You could gift the additional copy to someone else.

### Why do you require purchasing Explore It! direct from the publisher instead of through some other channel?

I'll be honest: if you buy direct from my publisher instead of a distributor, I get a higher percentage of the sale. The royalties I receive from book sales enable me to justify the effort required to publish these materials for your use.

For what it's worth, the publisher is probably the best source for bulk orders anyway. If you will be running this class for a large number of participants, you can get a [bulk discount from Pragmatic Bookshelf](http://pragprog.com/frequently-asked-questions/volume-discounts).

## I am giving a conference presentation to 100 people and want to use an excerpt from these materials. Technically it falls under the commercial use license, but it's just not feasible for me to purchase books for all the audience members. Help?

If you have a use case that doesn't fit well under these license terms, please feel free to contact me at elisabeth at testobsessed dot com. We can probably work something out.
